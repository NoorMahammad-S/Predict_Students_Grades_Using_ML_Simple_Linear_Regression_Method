# Predict Students Grades Using ML Simple Linear Regression Method

## Overview

Python code for predicting students' grades using a simple linear regression method. The linear regression model is built based on the number of study hours, aiming to predict the corresponding marks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is stored in a CSV file, which should be provided in the path specified in the code. Ensure that the dataset includes columns for "Hours" (independent variable) and "Marks" (dependent variable).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NoorMahammad-S/Predict_Students_Grades_Using_ML_Simple_Linear_Regression_Method.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Update the `url` variable in the code with the correct path to your dataset.

4. Run the code:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Code Structure

- **`main.py`**: Python script containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`.gitignore`**: Configuration file specifying files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python packages and their versions required for this project.

## Results

The code generates visualizations for the training and test sets, evaluates the model using Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error, and provides an example prediction for a specific number of study hours.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the project by opening issues, proposing enhancements, or submitting pull requests. Contributions are welcome!

Happy coding!
